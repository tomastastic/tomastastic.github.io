<h1>TOMAS ARANO Report: IS51018B Large Coursework</h1>

<p><strong>Link to my website:</strong> <a href="doc.gold.ac.uk/~taran001/PortfolioTA/index.html">doc.gold.ac.uk/~USERNAME/edit/this/path</a></p>

<p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</strong> These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</p>

<p>Visually my inspiration was LinkedIn, the colour pallet of white, dark grey and blue indicates innovating technology but also professionalism and honesty. On LinkedIn the leftmost button on the navigation bar takes you “home” just like on my website and the rightmost button takes you to your profile on LinkedIn, on my website it takes you to my CV.
In terms of task time and focus, meaning the time and effort it takes for a recruiter to retrieve relevant information from my portfolio website, Joshua Fluke’s YouTube videos reviewing portfolios were very insightful. He shows the good and bad practices when it comes to interface and usability.
I stumbled on some random student’s portfolio that she built while on a Google insight week, it was a good example of an undergrad’s achievable level of portfolio and content.

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></p>

<p>You can navigate my website through keyboard only use without mouse
I have added alternative text to my images for screen reader users.
I have chosen layout and font colours that contrast well and do not blend for colour blind users.
</p>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></p>

<p>My website is responsive to screen size for desktop and mobile use.
The task time to find any relevant information is minimized by for example; being able to scroll or click to the different sections.My lay out is sharp and  minimalist and one step to two steps away from any information in it.
When you mouse hover over the articles in the experience section  it creates shading effect to show you which one you are potentially going to click on.
Javascript was helpful for the navigation bar scrolling interaction and implemented in my Contact me form. In summary, I used different approaches to create a simple user interface.
</p>

<p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong> (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>

<p>Learning how to use the Bootstrap framework to create responsive layouts, the difference between padding and margin was especially difficult for me to understand and use.
Using and adapting three different templates to work together in a cohesive way, the portfolio template was the “foundation” and then I added the Articles cards in order to have a text and image display of articles. Once you click on them it leads you to another template which is a deconstructed “blog” template, meaning I got rid of unnecessary elements such as comment boxes. Making these three main templates work together without lay out bugs like an unresponsive footer was a main challenge.
The contact me form started by adding the template lay out which I then modified in conformity with the rest of the website. Lastly I set up the “back end” with formspree.io so that it would actually send emails.
</p>

<p><strong>What changes did you make to your site in response to the feedback you received for your first submission?</strong> Feedback was shared with you on the department intranet. If this is your first submisison, just write, `Not applicable'.</p>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other changes you made which you feel have improved the site?</strong> If so, explain why you decided to make the changes, and how they have improved the site. If this is your first submission, tell us here what you think has gone well with your submission.</p>

<p>What I am proud of in my submission was learning how to make a website with a framework because it use to scare me. Once I understood bootstrap enough to change things and the confidence to persevere through problems I felt very empowered. I am happy my website does not have any bugs (as far as I know) and nothing feels “wrong” with the design.
</p>

<p><strong>Are there any aspect(s) of your work that could still be improved, and if so, how might you achieve this?</strong> If this is your first submission, tell us here what you feel the weaknesses of the project are, and how you might do things differently another time.</p>

<p>Three things I want to improve about my website is:
Adding more article cards in the Experience section and more relevant information for recruiters to see in the other sections.
Make a new Experience lay out so that it uses more of the screen space on desktop and has clickable filtering options depending on the type of article card
Create a custom back end for my Contact me form so that it will work seamlessly (it won’t take you to a new page like it does now).
</p>

<p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong> You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</p>
